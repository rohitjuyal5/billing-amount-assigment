# Billing Amount Assignment

## Problem Statement
### Epic Context
As a big telecom brand outlet, on the eve of Christmas, we want to offer attractive seasonal discounts to our
customers to boost our retail sales for our sim card outlets partners.
As a retail outletâ€™s salesman, I should be able to calculate the customer's total billing including all
sims after considering applicable discount rates that are based on the billing amount and customer type
so that our retail outlet can maximize sales volume & value.

Discount Slabs for various billing amounts for the regular and premium customers are as follows:

Customer Type: Regular 
| Purchase Amount Slab | Discount % |
|:--------------------:|:----------:|
| $ 0 - $ 5,000        | Nil        |
| $ 5,000 - $10,000    | 10%        |
| $ 10,000 & above     | 20%        |
                                             
Customer Type: Premium
| Purchase Amount Slab | Discount % |
|:--------------------:|:----------:|
| $ 0 - $ 4,000        | 10%        |
| $ 4,000 - $ 8,000    | 15%        | 
| $ 8,000 - $ 12,000   | 20%        | 
| $ 12,000 & above     | 30%        |
